* _target component name: The name of the component of the running instance to patch._

###### Flags (Mandatory):

#### Cellery Route Traffic

This is used to direct a percentage of traffic originating from one cell instance to another. This command is used in advanced deployment patterns such as Blue-Green and Canary. 


###### Flags (Mandatory):

* _-d, --dependency: Existing dependency instance, which is currently receiving traffic from the relevant source instance(s)._
* _-t, --target: The new target instance to which traffic should be routed to._

###### Flags (Optional):

* _-s, --source: The source instance which is generating traffic for the dependency instance specified in the Parameters above. 
If this is not given all instances which are currently depending on the provided dependency instance will be considered._
* _-p, --percentage: The percentage of traffic to be routed to the target instance. If not specified, this will be considered to be 100%._
* _-a, --enable-session-awareness: Flag to enable session aware routing based on user name. An instance will be selected and will be propagated via the header `x-instance-id`. Its the cell component's responsibility to forward this header if this option is to be used._
* _-y, --assume-yes: Assume the answer as yes to any user prompts, such as the confirmation to continue with routing when there are api version mismatches._

Ex:
 ```
   cellery route-traffic --source hr-client-inst1 --dependency hr-inst-1 --target hr-inst-2 --percentage 20 
   cellery route-traffic --dependency hr-inst-1 --target hr-inst-2 --percentage 20

  components:
  - name: controller
    scalingPolicy:
      hpa:
        maxReplicas: 5
        metrics:
        - resource:
            name: cpu
            targetAverageUtilization: 50
          type: Resource
        minReplicas: 1
  - name: catalog
    scalingPolicy:
      replicas: 1
  - name: orders
    scalingPolicy:
      replicas: 1
  - name: customers
    scalingPolicy:
      hpa:
        minReplicas: 1
        maxReplicas: 3
        metrics:
        - resource:
            name: memory
            targetAverageValue: "64Mi"
